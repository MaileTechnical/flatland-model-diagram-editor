# color.yaml â€“ User defined flatland colors

# Basic color config pattern
# --
# <color_name>: {R: 255, G: 255, B: 255, Canvas: True}
# Name can have spaces and pretty much any string character
# RGB values are 0-255
# Canvas value is True or False
#    True indicates that your color is suitable as a canvas background (muted colors probably work best)
#          only these colors are reported with the --COLORS flag. It reports canvas colors, not diagnostic, etc
#    False indicates a vivid, dark color you intend for some other use, such as highlighting a model element
#          It will not be reported via the --COLORS flag.
